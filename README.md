# Multi-Diagnostic_GenAI_Applicatioon

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts the risk of four major diseases—**Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Stroke**—using pre-trained machine learning models. After each prediction, the app provides personalized health advice generated by Google Gemini AI, based on the user's input and prediction result.

---

## Features

- **User-friendly interface** for entering health data and navigating between disease prediction modules.
- **Accurate predictions** using pre-trained models for each disease.
- **Personalized health advice** generated by Gemini AI, tailored to the user's input and prediction.
- **Secure API key management** using a `.env` file.
- **Error handling** for robust user experience.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Health\ Predictions/Project
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add Your Gemini API Key

Create a `.env` file in the `Project` directory with the following content:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 5. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run App/app.py
```

## Usage

1. **Select a disease** from the sidebar or home page.
2. **Enter the required health information** in the form fields.
3. **Click the "Predict" button** to get your prediction and personalized advice.
4. **Review the results and recommendations**. Use the "Back to Home" button to return to the main menu.

## Models

- All models are pre-trained and stored in the `Models/` directory.
- Ensure the model files (`.pkl` and `.joblib`) are present before running the app.

---

## Security

- **API keys** are loaded from the `.env` file and never hardcoded.
- **.env** should **not** be committed to version control.

## Dependencies

- streamlit
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- python-dotenv
- google-generativeai
